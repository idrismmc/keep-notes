#  I want to run the tests when I create a new PR to make sure that the code is working as expected.
# once the test is successul merge the develop branch to nonprod branch
# also spin up the mongodb docker as it is used to connect to it
# docker run --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 -v ./data:/data/db -d mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-server:latest
